~clock
  tempo change knob (needs to have validation to ensure isn't twiddled by accident!)

~synthesis_functions
  return either a group or a synth itself
  logical layer over synthesis
  not involved in scheduling

~com_synth_groups
  each group is an IdentityDictionary[
    \uses_chords -> true/false,
    \chord_synths -> [Synth, Synth, Synth],
    \synth_name -> \symbol_of_synthdef_name,
    // DOES NOT INCLUDE \freq ARGUMENT
    \args -> [\outbus, ~buss[\outbus], \dur, 19.23324, etc...], 
    \target -> target,
    \add_message -> \add_before or whatev
  ];

~task_master
  user input
    to repeat or not to repeat, that is all
  knows where we are in the form of a given jam
  automates the scheduling of synthesis_function instantiation, pausing, and release
  stores attributes for current jam i.e.
    current_tempo
    current_chord
    current_key
    current_autosynths

~jams
  has many autosynths: // just playbufs for now?
    measure they should be instantiated, measure they should be released
  has measures_schema
    specifies the meter for each measure, chords, timesignature
  
~setlist
  array of jams in a specified order
